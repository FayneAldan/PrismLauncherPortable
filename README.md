# PolyMC Portable

Due to some unforunate events, PolyMC is no longer considered safe to use
and all downloads of PolyMC Portable have been pulled.
Please switch to a different launcher (such as [GDLauncher], [ATLauncher], or [MultiMC])
and consider checking out the new fork with all the previous devs:

- [Prism Launcher GitHub](https://github.com/PrismLauncher/PrismLauncher)
- [Prism Launcher Discord](https://discord.gg/prismlauncher)

I do plan to rename, rebrand, and continue this repository once
Prism Launcher has a stable version available for download.

[MultiMC]: https://multimc.org/
