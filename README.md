# Portable Java

**TL;DR:** [OpenJDK JRE 64-bit] and [jPortable (64-bit)] (for Minecraft 1.16.5 or older) are recommended.

PortableApps.com has several portable versions of Java that can be easily
installed and updated from the [PortableApps.com Platform](https://portableapps.com/download).
They can be found in the Utilities category and will be automatically detected by Prism Launcher Portable.
The 32-bit versions are likely to crash on newer versions of Minecraft and are not recommended
and the JDK versions contain extra developer tools that you likely don't need.
