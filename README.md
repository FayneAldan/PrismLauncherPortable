# PolyMC Portable

Due to some unforunate events, PolyMC is no longer considered safe to use
and all downloads of PolyMC Portable have been pulled.
Please switch to a different launcher, such as [GDLauncher] or [ATLauncher],
and consider checking out the new fork with all the previous devs:

- [Prism Launcher GitHub](https://github.com/PlaceholderMC/PrismLauncher)
- [Prism Launcher Discord](https://discord.gg/prismlauncher)

I do plan to rebrand and continue this repository once Prism Launcher
has a stable version available for download.

[ATLauncher]: https://atlauncher.com/
