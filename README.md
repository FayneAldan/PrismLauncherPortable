# Portable Java

PortableApps.com has several portable versions of Java that can be esaily
installed and updated from the [PortableApps.com Platform](https://portableapps.com/download).
They can be found in the Utilities category and will be automatically detected by Prism Launcher Portable.

| App Name    | Java Version |
| ----------- | ------------ |
| jdkPortable | JDK 8        |
| jPortable   | JRE 8        |
| OpenJDK     | JDK 17       |
| OpenJDK JRE | JRE 17       |

The 64-bit versions of both OpenJDK JRE and jPortable are recommended for Minecraft.
The JDK versions contain extra developer tools that you likely don't need.
